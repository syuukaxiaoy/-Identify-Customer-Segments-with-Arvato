# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato
 I will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that I will use has been provided by  **Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics**, and represents a real-life data science task.

In these cells, I will report my findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that I made in my approach to each subtask. 

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

 + NumPy
 + pandas
 + Sklearn / scikit-learn
 + Matplotlib (for data visualization)
 + Seaborn (for data visualization)
